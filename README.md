# DBMSInventoryControlAndManagement
The aim of the inventory control and management database is to enable small and large enterprises to keep a track of the stock of goods, so that based on the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) the company can minimize the cost of holding the inventory and hence maximize the profit.
The system also enables the enterprise to store: 
- Location of the warehouses for the goods
- Employee information and their bank details to transfer salary to
- Details of suppliers and retailers
- Tax on goods 
- Transactions taken place with suppliers (orders) and retailers (sales).
 
## Economic Order Quantity
Economic order quantity (EOQ) is the ideal order quantity a company should purchase for its inventory given a set cost of production, a certain demand rate, and other variables. This is done to minimize inventory holding costs and order-related costs.
### Q = sqrt((2*D*S)/H)
Q = EOQ units
D = demand in units (typically on annual basis)
S = order cost (per purchase order)
H = holding costs (per unit, per year)
